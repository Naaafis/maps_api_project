FILE_STRUCTURE_SUMMARY = """
/pages:

The pages folder should contain one folder for each page in your application. 
Inside of those page specific folders should be a single root file that is your page (generally index.js) alongside all the files that are only applicable to that page. 
For example, if we have a Login page, the Login folder should contain the root file index.js, a component called LoginForm, and a custom hook called useLogin. 
This component and hook are only ever used in the Login page so they are stored with this page instead of being stored in the global hooks or components folders.
Additionally, any component level tests should be stored in the Login folder in a directory called __tests__.

/components:

The components folder stores all the components of our react app and is further broken down into subfolders. 
These subfolders are really useful since they help keep your components organized into different sections instead of just being one massive blob of components. 
For example, we can have a ui folder which contains all our UI components like buttons, modals, cards, etc. 
We can also have a form folder for form specific controls like checkboxes, inputs, date pickers, etc.
You can customize and breakdown this components folder however you see fit based on your project needs, 
but ideally this folder shouldn’t get too large as many of your more complex components will be stored in the pages folder.

/hooks:

The hooks folder contains the global hooks that are used across multiple pages. 
This is because all page specific hooks are stored in the pages folder.

/assets:

The assets folder contains all images, css files, font files, etc. for your project.
Pretty much anything that isn’t code related will be stored in this folder.

/context:

The context folder stores all your React context files that are used across multiple pages. 
On larger projects, you will have multiple context you use across your application.
Having a single folder to store them is really useful. 
If you are using a different global data store such as Redux you can replace this folder with a more appropriate set of folders for storing Redux files instead.

/data:

The data folder is similar to the assets folder, but this is for storing our data assets such as JSON files that contain information used in our code (store items, theme information, etc). 
This folder can also store a file that contains global constant variables. This is useful when you have lots of constants you use across your application, such as environment variables.

/utils:

The utils folder is for storing all utility functions such as formatters. 
This is a pretty straightforward folder and all the files in this folder should likewise be straightforward. 
Generally, only store pure functions in this folder since if a utility function has side effects then it is most likely not just a simple utility function. 
Obviously there are exceptions to this rule.
